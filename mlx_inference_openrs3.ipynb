I know that the sky is blue, but why? I guess it has something to do with the color of the light we see. Maybe it's because of the color of the Earth itself. I remember reading that the Earth is blue, so maybe that's part of it.\n",

But why does the sky appear blue specifically? Maybe it's because the light we see is mostly blue, but it's a combination of all the colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it has something to do with the atmosphere. Air is transparent to some colors and opaque to others. I remember that blue light is absorbed by the atmosphere more than red light. So, when sunlight enters the atmosphere, blue light is scattered more than the other colors. That must be why the sky is blue because the blue light is scattered in all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n",
